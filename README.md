# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This application interacts with an external API:
* [Poke Api](http://pokeapi.co/docs/v2)

The goal is to create a draft of a game where you and your Pokémon team battle against opponent Pokémon.

# Technical details
The project uses a non-blocking, reactive WebClient for communication with external APIs.
Built with Spring WebFlux for fully reactive programming.
Written in Java with Project Reactor.
Note: Due to time constraints, the project has limited functionality.

# SideNote
While developing this project, I realized that my initial scope was too ambitious given the available time. As a result, I had to reduce the list of planned features.
Additionally, I acknowledge that not all classes are fully covered by unit tests.
